## Visual Assets - Graphics
Describe the Visual Assets needed for the game, including character models, environmental assets, animations, textures, and special effects. 

Recommendation: list each item as Vital (V), Desired(D) and Non-Vital (N). Vital items are needed for the completion of the game

Every graphical resource that will be used, needs to be linked here:
- [[2D Models]]
- [[3D Models]]
- [[Character Design]]
- [[Models]]
- [[Environment]]

## Audio Assets
Detail the audio assets required, such as background music, sound effects, voiceovers, and ambient sounds

Provide guideline for audio quality, tone, and implementation to enhance immersion and atmosphere
Every audio file needed should be listed here:
- [[Audio|Sound effects]]
- [[Audio|Soundtrack]]

## UI/UX Assets
Identify the User Interface (UI) elements needed for menus, HUDs (Heads-Up Displays), buttons, icons and other graphical interfaces

Discuss the User Experience (UX) considerations for usability and visual hierarchy
## Concept Art 
Showcase [[Concept Art]]t and Visual References to communicate the art style, character designs, environments and overall aesthetic vision

Use concept art to inspirate and guide the development of visual assets throughout the production process

## Asset Pipeline
Outline the Asset Pipeline, including workflows, tools, ad processes for creating, importing and managing assets

Define roles and responsibility for artists, animators and other team members involved in asset creation and integration

## Asset Management
Discuss asset organization and management strategies to ensure efficient storage, version control and collaboration among team members

Consider using asset management software or cloud-based solutions to streamline asset workflows and maintain project integrity

## External Resources
Identify any [[External Resources]] needed, such as third-party asset packs, licensed content or outsourcing services for specialized asset creation

Discuss the procurement process, budget considerations and legal requirements for using external source

## Localization Assets
If the game requires localization for different languages and regions , outline the assets needed for text translation, voiceover recording, and cultural adaptation

Consider how localization may impact visual and audio assets and plan accordingly to accommodate different languages and character sets 

## Quality Assurance (QA) Assets
Include assets needed for QA Testing, such as debug tools, test environments and documentation for tracking bugs and issues related to assets

Ensure assets are tested across various platforms, resolutions and hardware configurations to maintain quality and consistency

## Storyboarding
[[Storyboarding]] is a crucial step in visualizing key cutscenes, gameplay sequences, or cinematic moments in the game. This subsection provides a framework for planning and visualizing these sequences, ensuring coherence and clarity in conveying the intended narrative and pacing

Map out the flow of events, camera angles and character actions to effectively communicate the indented narrative

Describe the process of creating storyboards, including tools and techniques used. Keep in mind the collaboration between writers, directors, artists, and animators in developing storyboards that capture the vision for each scene
## Mood Boards
[[Mood Boards]] serve as visual references to establish the art style, atmosphere, and overall mood of the game. This subsection introduces the concept of mood boards and their importance in guiding the artistic direction of the game.

Mood boards compile images, colors, textures, and other visual elements that evoke the desired mood and aesthetic, providing a visual roadmap for artists, designers, and other team members
