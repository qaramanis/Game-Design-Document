## Project Overview
Provide a brief overview of the development plan, including the project's scopes, goals and timelines

Summarize key milestones and deliverables to be achieved throughout the development process

## Timeline and Milestones
Outline the development timeline, breaking down the project into key phases, milestones and deadlines

Define specific milestones for pre-production, production, alpha beta and release-phases, as well as pos-launch support and updates

These can be easier to track using [[Mood Boards]]

## Pre-Production Phase
Detail the pre-production phase, including concept development, prototyping, research, and planning activities

Define tasks such as creating concept art, designing gameplay mechanics, developing a technical roadmap, and conducting market research.

## Production Phase
Describe the production phase, where the majority of game development work takes place, including asset creation, programming, level design, and testing

Break down development tasks into manageable units, assign responsibilities to team members, and establish deadlines for completing each task

## Alpha and Beta Testing
Discuss the [[Alpha and Beta Testing]] phases, where the game is tested internally and externally to identify and address bugs, usability issues and performance concerns

Define criteria for Alpha and Beta builds, establish testing protocols and allocate time for bug fixing and optimization

## Polishing and Optimization
Outline the [[Polishing and Optimization]] phase, where final touches are applied to the game to enhance its quality and performance

Address tasks such as refining gameplay mechanics, balancing difficulty, optimizing graphics and performance and integrating player feedback

## Post-Launch Support
Discuss plans for post-launch support, including patching, updates, downloadable content (DLC), community management, and ongoing player engagement.

Allocate resources and schedule regular updates to address player feedback, fix bugs, and introduce new content and features.

## Risk Management and Contingency Plans
Identify potential risks and challenges that may arise during development, such as technical issues, scope creep, resource constraints and/or market changes

Develop contingency plans and mitigation strategies to address risks and minimize their impact on the project timeline and deliverables 

## Resource Allocation and Budget Management
Calculate and manage the [[Budget]] available for the development of the game among the different sections and parts

Essential for ensuring that the necessary personnel, tools and equipment are available to execute the project effectively

Identify the number of personnel and the roles and responsibilities of each team member including, developers, artists, designers, testers, project managers and support stuff

List the tools, software and developments environments needed to support the development process and their cost (if any)

Identify any external resources or services required to supplement internal capabilities, such as outsourcing partners, freelancers, consultants, or third-party vendors
